<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Installs Filebeat Windows service.
.DESCRIPTION
    Installs Filebeat Windows service, the data and logs path are
    set as part of the command for the service.

    For Filebeat < 9.1.0 the data path used to be
    'C:\ProgramData\Filebeat' (set from '$env:ProgramData) for >= 9.1.0
    the new default is 'C:\Program Files\Filebeat-Data'
    (set from '$env:ProgramFiles').

    If the legacy data path exists, then the script will move it to the new place,
    regardless of Filebeat version.

    You can pass ForceLegacyPath to use the legacy data path.

    If the Windows service already exists, it will be stopped and deleted, then
    the new one will be installed.
